## Semi-Standardized Keys That Can Be Used To Interpret & Validate a Driver's License from the United States of America.

## UPDATED MAY 2025

***Document Tags: USA Driver's License, US DL, Keys, Tags, AAMVA, PDF417, fields, encoding, barcode, standards, May 2025, Updated***

Below is a Semi-Standard Set of Fields/Values encoded in US Driver's Licenses, specifically in the PDF417-formatted AAMVA barcode. There is also documentation for the Code 128 Barcode seen in 2014 version licenses in stretched,
long-style across the tops of licenses in the 2014 Era, as well as Code 128 barcodes in 2023-Current, seen commonly at a 90 degree angle and usually positioned near the AAMVA-PDF417 barcode.

Code 128 Barcode in newer licenses (including Real ID Licenses) This is usually an 11 digit number which is derived from a currently unknown source. It is usually found within the AAMVA-PDF417 barcode under the "DCK" field. 

The fields below cover Driver's Licenses in the USA that are under the guidance of the AAMVA, however the exact details of the data contained within the barcode can vary from state to state. There is no specific set standard that is nationalized in the USA as of writing this (MAY 2025). 
While some fields may not be standard, this document has attempted to standardize some of the data that has been successfully mapped as of 2019. Standard for US Driver's Licenses defines 9 different barcode standards (AAMVA versions) with over 80 different fields encoded inside the barcode.
